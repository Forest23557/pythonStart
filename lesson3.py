# Arithmetic Operators and Strings

# Arithmetic Operators:
# + - * / % 

age1 = 18
age2 = 12

# print(age1 + age2)
# print(age1 - age2)
# print(age1 * age2)
# print(age1 / age2)
# print(age1 % age2)

# Strings:

sent1 = "today is a breathtaking day"
# print(sent1)

firstName = "Peter"
lastName = "Parker"

# print(firstName + " " + lastName)
# print("Hi " * 10) # 10 times

print(sent1[0]) # t
print(sent1[1]) # o
print(sent1[0:5]) # today, last index in Python is exclusive
