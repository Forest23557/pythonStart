# Variables (We can use characters, numbers and underscore to a label of a variable)

# _some = 5
# _some_value = 10
# value2 = 5
# some = 2
# value_2 = 3
# HEIGHT = 8
# Height = "String"

# Expressions and statements

# Expressions return a value
# 1+1
# "smth"

# Statements do some operations with a value
# number = 1
# print(number)
# name = "John"; print(name)
# Space (Indentation) and tabulations have a spacial meaning in Python
 
# Data types

# String
# name = "Clark"
# print(type(name)) # <class 'str'>
# type() is a function to feagure out what type has a value
# print(type(name) == str)
# isinstance(value, type that we want to compare to)
# print(isinstance(name, str)) # True

# Integer
# age = 2 
# print(isinstance(age, int))

# Float (Decimal number)
# float_number = 4.56
# print(isinstance(float_number, float))

# Convert from one type to anoter
# number = float(2)
# print(isinstance(number, float)) # True

# number = "5"
# string_number = int(number) # Casting from integer to string
# print(isinstance(string_number, int)) # True

# Types in Python:
# int for integers
# str for strings
# float for decimal numbers
# comlex for complex numbers
# bool for booleans
# list for lists
# tuple for tuples
# range for ranges
# dict for dictionaries
# set for sets

# Operators

#Arithmetic Operators
1 + 1 #2 Addition
2 - 1 #1 Subtraction
2 * 2 #4 Multiplication
4 / 2 #2 Division
4 % 3 #1 Remainder
4 ** 2 #16 Exponentiation
4 // 2 #2 Floor division rounds down 
# In Python, we can perform floor division (also sometimes known as integer division) using the // operator. This operator will divide the first argument by the second and round the result down to the nearest whole number, making it equivalent to the math. floor() function
1 + -1 #0

# print("Champ " + "is a good boy " + str(5))
